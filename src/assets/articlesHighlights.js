    textCopy: '    <p style="text-indent:0">Grope the menu of a fine restaurant or the produce section of a specialty grocery store, and you\'re likely to spy microgreens: tiny, delicate greens that add color, texture and flavor to a variety of foods as a garnish or ingredient. </p><p>    Big on nutrition and flavor, microgreens can be expensive to purchase. But they can also be grown cost-effectively at home, in a tiny space and with simple supplies. If you have a sunny windowsill, a shallow container, some potting mix and suitable seeds, you\'ve got all the essentials for growing your own microgreens. This is a great crop for urban gardeners who are limited to a windowsill, balcony or fire escape.</p><p> What are microgreens?</p><p> Also known as "vegetable confetti," microgreens are sometimes confused with sprouts — germinated seeds that are eaten root, seed and shoot. Microgreens, however, include a variety of edible immature greens, harvested with scissors less than a month after germination, when the plants are up to 2 inches tall. The stem, cotyledons (or seed leaves) and first set of true leaves are all edible.</p><p> Which seeds work best?</p><p>  Salad greens, leafy vegetables, herbs and even edible flowers can be grown as microgreens, though some varieties are better suited than others. Beginners often start by growing one type of seed, such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, mustard, chia, sunflower or buckwheat — among the easiest-to-grow varieties of microgreens — in a single container. (You can easily grow different seeds in several containers, and mix your microgreens after harvesting.)</p><p>  You can also find seeds for salad mixes and specially selected microgreen mixes that combine greens with similar growth rates, compatible flavors and beautiful coloring including reds, purples and greens. Since they were created with grower success in mind, they\'re also a good choice for beginners.</p><> If your climate is suitable, microgreens can be also be grown outdoors in the garden, under shade. Like all fragile seedlings, you\'ll need to protect them from weather extremes and drying winds, not to mention hungry garden pests.</p> '

First, new computing systems running machine learning algorithms are processing huge amounts of data and making critical decisions. Second, the explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables users to interact with computing systems and physical environments in novel ways through perceptual interfaces (e.g., microphones and cameras). Third, hybrid Human-AI systems (e.g., driving assistance in smart cars) are emerging and will change all aspects of life, including education, healthcare, and transportation. While these trends bring more functionality, at the same time, they drastically increase the number of untrusted and biased algorithms, implementations, and interfaces, as well as the amount of private data processed by them. As a result, large-scale attacks on IoT and machine learning systems are increasingly prevalent. These lead to emerging technical challenges and public policy issues. </p><p> My research goal is to provide principled solutions to the security, privacy, and ethical problems of AI-enabled computing systems. To achieve this goal, I go beyond traditional disciplinary barriers and innovate at the crossroads of machine learning, security and privacy, system, and human-computer interaction. My research on practical solutions with provable guarantees has advanced security, machine learning, and cyber-physical systems. My work has two main themes: (1) building foundations for the security, privacy, and fairness of machine learning systems considering practical factors; (2) designing machine-learning-augmented technologies to improve security, privacy, and usability in modern and emerging computing platforms. </p><p> Bio: Yuan Tian is an Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Institute for Technology, Law and Policy (ITLP) at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Her research optimizes the complementary functions of electronic and photonic devices to introduce a hybrid methodology for designing systems with operation frequencies beyond traditional transistor technologies. </p><p>The award will be used to further Jarrahi’s research in developing key building block components of the next-generation terahertz optoelectronic systems so they can be integrated into one platform. Currently, these system components require different manufacturing methods, complex setups and bulky housing in order for them to connect and work properly. Just as modern integrated circuits technology has transformed refrigerator-sized, power-hungry early computers into much higher-performance microprocessor chips used in homes, cars, phones and health-monitoring systems, Jarrahi aims to enable a similar technological revolution in the terahertz field. </p><p> “My team is developing a monolithically integrated terahertz optoelectronics platform to transform terahertz communication, imaging and sensing systems from expensive, bulky, tabletop setups used in laboratory and industrial settings into scalable, compact and low-cost microchips used in our everyday lives for various applications, such as non-invasive medical diagnostics, ultra-sensitive food, drug-safety screening and high-data-rate communication,” Jarrahi said. Professor Jarrahi presented her research at a lecture hosted by the IET, moderated by IET President Sir Julian Young. The presentation was live-streamed on the IET’s YouTube channel and is available online.</p><p> “The IET’s A F Harvey Engineering Research Prize supports the world’s best scientists and engineers to advance their research,” Young said. “The technological revolution in the terahertz field is highly promising, and we are excited to support the pioneering work of Professor Jarrahi and her team. This research should transform our approach to high-performance, integrated systems that have a wide-range of important applications and will benefit us all.” </p><p>Established in 2011, the IET A F Harvey Engineering Research Prize is awarded annually to a researcher in one of three engineering areas on a rotating basis: medical engineering and technology, lasers and optoelectronics, and radar and microwaves. The prize commemorates the late British electronic engineer Arthur Frank Harvey, whose gift to the IET supports research in these fields. The U.K.-based organization, with nearly 160,000 members in more than 150 countries, seeks to inspire, inform and influence the global engineering community to engineer a better world. </p><p> Jarrahi is the Northrop Grumman Endowed Chair at the Samueli School of Engineering, the director of the Terahertz Electronics Laboratory and a member of the California NanoSystems Institute. She has received numerous prestigious honors for her work, including an inaugural Moore Inventor Fellowship from the Gordon & Betty Moore Foundation in 2016 and a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2013. She is a frequent collaborator with researchers at UCLA, other institutions and industry. </p>'
