    articleAuthor: 'Professor Achuta Kadambi',
    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Achuta Kadambi </span>published a column in the journal <span>Science</span> about how medical devices can be fundamentally biased — not just in dataset representation as has been widely reported, but from a deeper root: the laws of physics. Kadambi described how the inherent physics behind medical devices could vary across race and gender. He cited several examples of potential physics-based bias. For example, recent research has shown that a pulse oximeter — a medical device typically placed on a fingertip that uses infrared and light beams to measure oxygen saturation of the blood and the pulse rate — is more likely to miss low levels in people with darker skin.</p><p>    What motivated Kadambi to write this piece stemmed from an incident at an airport when he noticed he had difficulties triggering light-sensing soap, faucet and towel dispensers, which he attributed to his darker complexion and the physics of light. While these factors might result in mere inconvenience when using a light-sensing faucet or towel dispenser, Kadambi said they might present life-threatening consequences in critical application domains such as medicine. To address these challenges, Kadambi offered a few suggestions on how to prevent these unintentional biases and improve equity in medical devices. For starters, he suggested that medical devices journals require authors to quantify sample fairness in experiments. At present, scientists are only required to provide statistics relating to the performance of a device without the human factor.</p><p>    Another critical point raised by Kadambi in this piece involves recalibrating how a medical device’s performance is measured. In such a scenario, the performance rating of existing medical devices may suffer when a quantifiable metric, such as race or ethnicity of a population, is included in evaluating the equipment. This is a concept similar to the Pareto efficiency in economics, whereby when enhancement made to benefit one metric (e.g. fairness) leads to diminution on another (e.g. device performance on the majority). If a life-saving medical device does not work well on minority populations, should it be redesigned at the expense of the majority? Kadambi noted that society historically has had great difficulties in solving such a conundrum.</p>  <h3>National Science Foundation CAREER Award</h3><p>A recent National Science Foundation CAREER Award will fund Kadambi’s research into the physics of light and how it interacts with variations in skin types and colors. The award includes a five-year, $500,000 grant to support Kadambi’s research toward developing light-based sensing technologies, such as facial recognition or medical imaging, that are more inclusive across a diverse spectrum of skin colors and types. Anatomical variations — darker to lighter shades, or smoother versus more wrinkled skin — often influence how someone’s image appears on sensing devices. Current efforts to make technologies more fair and inclusive have focused on using artificial intelligence to discern information. Instead, Kadambi will lead research that explores the physics of light and how it interacts with variations in appearances. Kadambi noted that the inspiration for pursing this topic derived from his own experiences with light-based sensor technologies, including one frustrating incident at an airport where he had to ask fellow travelers to help him activate light-controlled soap, water and towel dispensers that failed to trigger on his darker skin tone.</p><h3>US Army Young Investigator Grant for Fairness in AI Research</h3><p> Profeessor Kadambi received a Young Investigator Program (YIP) award from the Army Research Office to support his ongoing research into incorporating fairness in the development of imaging and sensing technologies. The three-year, $360,000 award will support a research project involving a new camera design that can produce photographs less prone to bias towards certain skin tones. Kadambi and his students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering will develop a hardware design that would use neural networks to manipulate the electronics and optics of the camera in order to remove implicit bias.</p><p>    Traditional RGB (red-green-blue) images composed of pixels with these three colors often accentuate differences in skin color. Kadambi’s camera design will incorporate an algorithm that does not solely rely on the use of the RGB format. Instead, the system will utilize information from supplemental data, such as heat-based thermal imaging, in order to reduce the undue impact of an individual’s skin color.    <p>In 2018, Kadambi joined the UCLA faculty and has since taught courses on digital-imaging processing and computational imaging. He leads the Visual Machines Group, which develops computational-imaging systems to enhance sight for machines. Such technologies could apply to autonomous vehicles, search-and-rescue robots, as well as advanced imaging for medicine and health care. In addition to receiving a Google Faculty Award, Kadambi has been elected a senior member of the National Academy of Inventors, and was included in Forbes 2019 ’30 Under 30‘ list for science. He is also the co-founder and chief scientist for Akasha Imaging, a venture-backed startup that designs camera hardware and artificial intelligence to enhance computer vision.'

    textCopy: '<p  style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Professor Xiang </span>  “Anthony” Chen has received a three-year, $510,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research.  The highly competitive award will support Chen’s research on extracting domain-specific knowledge through human interaction with artificial intelligence. Chen is among the 39 researchers honored in the U.S. Navy’s 2021 award cohort. The awards are designed to support reasonable costs related to conducting the proposed research. </p><p>   As an executive branch agency within the Department of Defense, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) supports the President’s budget. ONR provides technical advice to the Chief of Naval Operations and the Secretary of the Navy. Chen has received several other awards for early career faculty, including a Hellman Fellowship and the National Science Foundation’s CAREER Award.</p><h3>Hellman Fellowship</h3>    <p>    The Hellman family began the Hellman Fellows Program in 1994, making grants to colleges and universities in support of junior faculty research.  Over the years, the Hellman Fellows program has supported more than 1,500 faculty members, who are now chairs and heads of departments, MacArthur Geniuses and tenured faculty with long track records of successful research.</p><p>    Professor Chen’s project focuses on how the recent development of data-driven AI (e.g., deep learning) is rejuvenating the use of AI in medicine originally started in the 1950s. However, for medical professionals without a computational background, a lack of transparency creates a barrier that prevents AI from being widely adopted in practice. To overcome limitations of traditional AI, the long-term goal of his research in human-computer interaction is to discover empirical evidence, techniques, and principles that enable us to build an ecosystem of human-centered medical AI to augment physicians’ work.</p><h3>National Science Foundation CAREER award</h3><p>    The National Science Foundation CAREER award is the agency’s highest honor for faculty members in the early stages of their teaching and research careers. The award includes a five-year, $548,000 grant to support Chen’s research enabling physicians to analyze medical images, such as X-ray and tissue scans, using artificial intelligence. </p><p>    Chen plans to develop an interface that will help AI programs explain how they came up with their findings, and thereby allow doctors much more control in how they interact with an AI-powered technology. For example, doctors could adjust the AI to incorporate details of a specific patient and add new medical information as it becomes available. </p><p>    In collaboration with physicians from the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Chen seeks to incorporate their recommendations and preferences in order to design an interface that will meet the needs of medical professionals. </p><p>   </p><p> At UCLA, Chen leads HCI Research, which specializes in human-computer interaction with an emphasis on AI solutions. The research group focuses on designing intelligent user interfaces, new sensing and interaction techniques, as well as computational platforms that extend beyond a screen and keyboard. <a class="link" href=https://hci.ucla.edu/><span>https://hci.ucla.edu/</span></a></p>'

Quantum computers offer the tantalizing promise of unprecedented computing power and speed — far exceeding even that of today’s best supercomputers. The NSF’s Convergence Accelerator program supports multidisciplinary research efforts to realize such advancements.    Led by Wang, Raytheon Professor of Electrical Engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, the project will explore how to improve quantum computing chips.</p><p>    One of the current roadblocks lies in quantum interconnects, which involve the transfer of delicate quantum information from one part of a computer chip to another. In a typical computer, interconnects are the lines that connect multiple transistors to one another and complete a circuit in a computer. In the quantum realm, these interconnects must be carefully engineered to isolate them from ambient noise to protect the fragile quantum bits (or qubits) that store and process quantum information.   </p><p>Quantum signals passing through this material move only in one direction, allowing information to transfer externally while blocking noise that could interfere with the quantum system. The proposed new quantum computer chips that use these materials in their interconnects could overcome several technical hurdles in quantum computing, such as improving performance, reducing the footprint of hardware and connecting different quantum computers into a larger network. </p><p> The co-principal investigators on the project are Clarice Aiello, UCLA assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering; Thomas Ohki of Raytheon BBN Quantum Engineering and Computing in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Ajey Jacob of USC’s Information Science Institute and Jonathan DuBois of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Wang, a distinguished professor, also holds faculty appointments at UCLA in materials science and engineering, and physics and astronomy. Wang and Aiello are members of the UCLA Center for Quantum Science and Engineering. If the project proves successful, the research team could be eligible for longer-term funding from the NSF.  </p>'

"Professor Aiello greatly values networking and helping her group members, both postdocs and graduate students, create lasting and meaningful connections with others within the academic community. Professor Aiello encompasses everything a postdoc and graduate student would want in an advisor. Her ability to communicate and her openness to creative ideas makes it easy for her students to succeed in academia." In 2012, the Society of Postdoctoral Scholars began honoring exemplary faculty mentors in recognition of the importance of excellent mentorship for postdoctoral research success. Today, through the Postdoctoral Scholars Mentoring Award the Postdoctoral Association at UCLA continues that tradition. </p><p><h3>UCLA Library Grant</h3>    Professor Aiello also received the UCLA Library Grant to Develop Affordable Course Materials.  She was awarded a one-time $5,000 grant from the UCLA Library’s Affordable Course Materials Initiative to develop materials for her  course on quantum mechanics for engineers. She is one of three professors to receive the award, which is made in conjunction with OpenUCLA, the UCLA Library’s Centennial Initiative. The awards program provides support to professors who create original, open educational resources that eliminate the need for students to purchase course textbooks.</p><p> “The library’s ACMI awards are meant to encourage faculty to create affordable course materials by compensating them for the time it takes to develop them,” said associate university librarian Alison Scott, who administers the program. “We have successfully collaborated with instructors to help them achieve their educational objectives, and we have eased the financial burden for thousands of UCLA students." </p>'
