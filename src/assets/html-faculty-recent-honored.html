<div class="page-text">
        <p>The <span>National Academy of Inventors </span>was founded in 2010 to recognize and encourage inventors with patents issued from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, enhance the visibility of academic technology and innovation, encourage the disclosure of intellectual property, educate and mentor innovative students, and translate the inventions of its members to benefit society. National Academy of Inventors is a US non-profit organization dedicated to encouraging inventors in academia, following the model of the National Academies of the United States. The NAI Senior Member program is an exclusive award distinction reserved for NAI Member Institutions like University of California, Los Angeles. NAI Senior Members are active faculty, scientists and administrators with success in patents, licensing and commercialization and have produced technologies that have brought, or aspire to bring, real impact on the welfare of society. Senior Members also foster a spirit of innovation within their communities through enhancing an inventive atmosphere at their institutions, while educating and mentoring the next generation of inventors.

        <img class="logo-pic" src="/2020-2021/img/samueli_IEEEmedal.jpg" alt="UCLA ECE Henry Samueli IEEE Founders Medal">

        <p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has chosen Henry Samueli as the recipient of the 2021 IEEE Founders Medal. The namesake of UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and chair of the board of Broadcom Inc., Samueli is also a triple Bruin and an electrical and computer engineering professor at UCLA. Samueli joins a list of engineering luminaries and electronics industry titans who have received the IEEE Founders Medal. Previous recipients include David Sarnoff, the longtime leader of the Radio Corporation of America; HP founders William Hewlett and David Packard; electronics and defense industry executive Simon Ramo; Intel co-founder Gordon Moore; and nanotechnology pioneer Mildred Dresselhaus.</p>

        <p>Samueli earned his bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees from the UCLA School of Engineering. In 1991, while still teaching at UCLA, he co-founded Broadcom Corporation with one of his Ph.D. students, Henry Nicholas. The company became a global leader in providing semiconductor technologies and infrastructure software for wired and wireless communications. In addition to his many professional achievements, Samueli is also a prominent philanthropist. Both the engineering schools at UCLA and UC Irvine are named in Samueli’s honor. In 2019, Samueli and his wife Susan gave $100 million to UCLA through the Samueli Foundation as part of the university’s Centennial Campaign to support the growth of UCLA Engineering.</p>

        <p>Samueli has received numerous international honors for his contributions to communications technology, including the Global Semiconductor Alliance Dr. Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award and the Marconi Society Prize and Fellowship. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and a fellow of IEEE, the National Academy of Inventors and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

        <h2>Jonathan Kao awarded NIH innovative grant to develop AI-driven Brain-Machine Interface</h2>
        <p>The <span> National Institute of Health (NIH)</span> awarded assistant professor Jonathan Kao a Director\’s New Innovator Award. Established by NIH in 2007, the New Innovator Award supports unusually innovative research from early career investigators who are within 10 years of receiving their final degree  nd have not previously received a research project grant or equivalent NIH grant. The award includes a five-year, $2.34 million grant to support Kao’s research on accelerating the development of technologies for brain-machine interfaces, which could help people who are paralyzed regain a sense of control and independence.</p>

        <p>More than five million people in the U.S. live with some form of paralysis. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore their ability to communicate with the world by translating the brain’s neural signals into actions. BMIs decode these signals into the movements of a computer cursor on a screen or a robotic arm, allowing the user to interact with the world autonomously. Research on BMIs has been conducted for two decades, but the systems have not been widely adopted because BMIs have not achieved levels of performance that justify their costs and risks. Professor Kao aims to develop a next generation of what he calls AI-BMIs, which will harness artificial intelligence to greatly enhance their performance. This novel AI would work cooperatively with the user, predicting intended movements and helping to complete them. </p>

        <p>Professor Kao joined UCLA Samueli in 2017, where he directs the <span>Neural Computation and Engineering Laboratory.</span> He is also a faculty member in the UCLA Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine.  In September, Kao received a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation, with $575,000 to support his research. He also received a Brain & Behavior Research Foundation Young Investigator Grant and a Hellman Fellowship.</p>

        <p>Professor Mona Jarrahi was recently elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Physics. The fellowships are offered to those who are at “the peak of their career” and have had a substantial influence within their sector. The Institute of Physics is an international society for physics that fosters the advancement of knowledge, community, career development, and professional recognition for its members.</p>
        <p> Jarrahi’s election as a Fellow comes at a significant part of her career as she was recently awarded the Catalyzing Pediatric Innovation Grant from the West Coast Consortium for Technology & Innovation in Pediatrics for her work in making advancements in the pediatric field. The grant was awarded to five winners who worked on projects to improve care for infants and children. Jarrahi collaborated with Jose A. Pineda and Najmedin Meshkati, both professors at USC, to develop a terahertz scanner for pediatric vascular access. The venture addresses the difficult procedure of providing intravenous (IV) access to children by using the latest terahertz imaging technology developed in Jarrahi’s research group. </p>
