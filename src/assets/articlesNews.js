Iyer (Subu) received the Oustanding Educator Award from the International Microelectronics Assembly and Packaging Society (IMAPS). iProfessor Iyer is a Distinguished Professor and holds the Charles P. Reames Endowed Chair in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and a joint appointment in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at the University of California at Los Angeles. He is Director of the Center for Heterogeneous Integration and Performance Scaling (CHIPS). Prior to that he was an IBM Fellow. </p><p> Professor Iyer’s key technical contributions have been the development of the world’s first SiGe base HBT, Salicide, electrical fuses, embedded DRAM and 45nm technology node used to make the first generation of truly low power portable devices as well as the first commercial interposer and 3D integrated products. He also was among the first to commercialize bonded SOI for CMOS applications through a start-up called SiBond LLC. More recently, he has been exploring new packaging paradigms and device innovations that they may enable wafer-scale architectures, in-memory analog compute and medical engineering applications. He has published over 300 papers and holds over 75 patents.</p><p> He has received several outstanding technical achievements and corporate awards at IBM. He is an IEEE Life Fellow, an APS Fellow, an IMAPS Fellow and a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE EDS and EPS and a member of the Board of Governors of IEEE EPS. He is also a Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors. He is a Distinguished Alumnus of IIT Bombay and received the IEEE Daniel Noble Medal for emerging technologies in 2012. Las year, professor Iyer received the 2020 IMAPS Daniel C. Hughes Jr Memorial award. </p> <p> The IMAPS is the largest society dedicated to the advancement and growth of microelectronics and electronics packaging technologies through professional education. The Society’s portfolio of technologies is disseminated through premier professional events, an exclusive microelectronics packaging research library, local chapter networks, and other efforts. Founded in 1967 as ISHM, then merging with the International Electronic and Packaging Society (IEPS) in 1996, the Society has over 50 years of networking, education, and publication history.</p> '

    textCopy: ' <p style="text-indent:0"><span class="first-letter">A</span>ssociate professor Sam Emaminejad from the ECE department, with members of his UCLA Interconnected and Integrated Bioelectronics Lab (I²BL) in collaboration with colleagues from Stanford University, developed a technology that can analyze blood composition with the touch of a finger. This secure, noninvasive technology uses a signal-interpretation framework that can present detailed information about an individual\’s blood composition--such as metabolites, hormones, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, as well as blood oxygen. The first-of-its-kind system builds on previous skin-sensing technologies developed by the researchers, and a paper describing the new technology has recently been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS).</p><p>One potential application of the technology is to embed the sensors in cars\' steering wheels to measure blood alcohol and drug levels, preventing a driver to operate the vehicle under the influence (DUI). The system also could be incorporated into heavy machinery to ensure their operators are authorized and physically sound. "This touch-based technology can serve as a human-machine interface to perceive and interpret what\’s inside someone\’s body," said study leader and senior author Sam Emaminejad. "It provides much richer information about our health than current touch-based biosensors such as pulse oximeters. "The system, described by the researchers as a "cryptographic bio-human machine interface", or CB-HMI, uses thin hydrogel-coated chemical sensors to collect and detect particular circulating molecules on the skin through natural perspiration.</p><p>"This combines the familiarity of a fingerprint scan, such as the one that unlocks some smartphone models, with our advances in noninvasive diagnostics that can detect trace molecules circulating in our body that have been traditionally collected in samples of blood, saliva and other fluids", said Emaminejad, who is also a member of the UCLA California NanoSystems Institute. "Importantly, it also can encrypt the data at the point of collection by leveraging the individual\’s unique fingerprint as a key, so the collected data remain secure and private." For their experiments, the researchers developed thin hydrogel-coated sensors to measure ethanol and acetaminophen levels in the participants. They integrated these sensors with other biosensors and a fingerprint scanner and developed accompanying algorithms to decipher the information.</p> "The system authenticated the user before proceeding to the next steps", said lead author Shuyu Lin, a UCLA doctoral student and member of the Interconnected and Integrated Bioelectronics Lab. "We also applied our interface to create a smart medication dispenser that dispenses only the appropriate amount of acetaminophen depending on current levels in the blood." The researchers envision that such interfaces could be extended to create<span>"smart"</span>surroundings that adapt to individuals\’ needs and to monitor patients remotely. When connected to a aptop or tablet, the system could relay real-time, detailed physiological information from a patient to a doctor during a video visit.</p><p>The other lead authors of the paper are Emaminejad\’s UCLA graduate students and lab members Jialun Zhu and Wenzhuo Yu. Other UCLA authors from his lab include Bo Wang, Kiarash Sabet, Yichao Zhao, Xuanbing Cheng, Hannaneh Hojaiji, Haisong Lin and Jiawei Tan. The other senior authors are Dr. Carlos Milla and Ronald Davis from Stanford University. The research is supported by National Science Foundation\’s Smart and Connected Health program, Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations (PATHS-UP), PhRMA Foundation, UCLA Samueli School of Engineering and a UCLA Electrical and Computer Engineering Preliminary Examination Fellowship (to Shuyu Lin). The UCLA Technology Development Group has filed for a provisional U.S. patent on the technology for Emaminejad and the three lead authors.</p>'
