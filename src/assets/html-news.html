 <p style="text-indent:0;">
  <span class="first-letter"> Last academic </span> year had its share of
  uncertainties as we weathered the COVID-19 pandemic. What is not uncertain is
  the resilience, innovativeness, and achievements of our community toward
  teaching and learning, and new research efforts. In these aspects, this annual
  report is no different than others as we review the excellent unabated
  progress this department has made in 2020-2021.
</p>
<p>
  This past school year, along with dormitory and campus closures, all of our
  classes migrated to remote learning including lectures and laboratories.
  Despite not having in-person interaction, we maintained our standards through
  our live Zoom lectures and office hours. By adopting individual laboratory
  kits and USB-based instrumentation systems that were shipped to each student’s
  home, we enabled students to conduct experiments and design laboratories
  fully remotely. Some of the faculty experimented with live-streaming board
  talk and others with flipped classrooms, each to positive effect in enhancing
  our pedagogy. With students spanning the globe, faculty and lecturers were
  challenged to find new means of assessments and many adapted by establishing
  frequent criteria-based assessments and design projects rather than timed
  examinations.
</p>
<p>
  Our student organizations such as IEEE, Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), and ECE Graduate
  and Post-doctoral Students (ECEGAPS) have remained active. To counter the
  isolation and build community, they hosted game nights. Student projects
  hosted by the groups such as IEEE Ops were held by shipping design kits. HKN
  conducted tutoring sessions with the help of a Discord server. Even talent
  acquisition by industry continued with a departmental Career Fair held online.
</p>
<p>
  Exceptions to the campus closure were granted to research laboratories since
  the smaller number of researchers could be monitored carefully. As a result, while some of
  the research was less efficient without in-person interactions and meetings,
  most of the research activities persisted. In this past year, the department
  had research support of $33 million from extramural sources including
  Department of Defense (⅖), Department of Energy (⅙), National Science
  Foundation (⅙), NASA, National Institute of Health, and various industry
  sources.
</p>
<p>
  As in any other year, our faculty and students were recognized for their
  accomplishments. Professors A. Ozcan and K. Wang were named World’s Most
  Influential Researchers by citation. Professor A. Madni was elevated to Fellow
  of the Canadian National Academy of engineering. Professors J. Cong and B.
  Jalali were elected Fellows of the National Academy of Inventors. Professor H.
  Samueli received the IEEE Founders Medal, one of the highest honors of IEEE.
  Professors D. Markovic, and D. Cabric were elected Fellows of IEEE. The
  research of our younger faculty has also been recognized. Professor J. Kao
  received the coveted NIH Director’s New Innovator Award, and Professors A.
  Kadambi and X. Chen both received the Career Award from NSF and Young
  Investigator Program Award from our armed forces. The decorations also include
  our alumni Dr. A. Tang who received the MTT Young Engineer Award.
  These are but some of the more notable distinctions described in further
  detail in this report.
</p>
<p>
  We welcomed three new faculty this year. Professor Bahman Gharesfard,
  joining us from Queen’s University of Canada, focuses on ensuring the
  stability of adaptive control of autonomous systems such as self-driving
  vehicles. Professor Yang Zhang arrived bringing his innovative research on
  human-centered computing that increases the ways we humans interact with
  devices and smart environments. And Professor Sergio Carbajo, coming from
  Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, is developing electron beams that can
  measure precise ultra-short time scales on the order of femtoseconds (a
  quadrillionth of a second). Professor Carbajo is also a Mentorship Professor
  who has extensive experience in mentoring under-represented students. The
  research of these new faculty spans exciting areas that will bring new
  collaborations and activity within our department.
</p>
<p>
  Last year around this time, I wrote about the emergence of the vaccine. With
  its help and better monitoring and treatment, the new school year is starting
  with the reopening of our dormitories, facilities, and activities. This new
  beginning will inevitably lead to more changes and uncertainty as we embrace
  hybrid interactions both in daily departmental functions, research, and
  teaching. Many of our efforts to enable the flexibility of remote learning and
  work will be leveraged in the new paradigm. As I look ahead to the school
  year, my overwhelming impression shared by this community is the joy of
  sharing each other\'s company and the growing energy from in-person
  collaborations.

<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Our </span> environments are getting smarter. Advances in sensors, actuators, and communication have made the vision of ambient intelligence increasingly achievable. We have seen an increasing number of smarts around us such as voice assistants, service robots, UAVs, autonomous vehicles, and a broader array of connective objects in IoT. Professor Yang Zhang creates enabling technologies to make ambient intelligence more powerful in facilitating the future of work, healthcare, and education. He also researches human-centered design frameworks to make ambient intelligence and the environments they reside in equally accessible to all and can be developed by anyone. Professor Zhang is currently directing the Human-Centered Computing & Intelligent Sensing Lab (HiLab) at UCLA ECE. <span>https://www.hilab.dev</span></p>

<h3>Pillar 1: Create more powerful ambient intelligence</h3>
<p>HiLab creates sensing technologies to extend the capabilities of ambient intelligence. Such technologies improve the communication bandwidth between ambient intelligence by prepping everyday objects for interactivity -- intelligent walls that sense human poses, cameras that turn surfaces into high-precision touchscreens. Additionally, HiLab develops novel sensors that monitor events and user activities for environmental and personal informatics, such as cameras that sense vibrations to recognize building- and city-scale activities. Overall, this research pillar enables ambient intelligence to acquire knowledge from people either explicitly (i.e., interaction) or implicitly (i.e., event and activity recognition) in a practical manner.</p>

<h3>Pillar 2: Use ambient intelligence to make the physical world accessible to all</h3>
<p>Ambient intelligence also opens new opportunities for making the physical world equally accessible to all. Specifically, HiLab develops systems that can digitize the physical world for accessibility applications, including virtual and augmented reality techniques that allow people with disabilities to better navigate through a world full of barriers and inaccessible information. HiLab also creates intelligent sensing and actuation systems that can be easily deployed by people with motor impairments (e.g., users of wheelchairs) for independent living and improved life qualities.</p>

<h3>Pillar 3: Lower the barrier for everyone to create ambient intelligence</h3>
<p>Finally, HiLab aims to empower everyone to create ambient intelligence. By improving their environments, people improve their lives (e.g., switching for a brighter lightbulb). We believe that people should be able to create ambient intelligence as easily as switching a lightbulb. Besides sponsoring the community with toolkits of existing research, HiLab also seeks general design frameworks that can be easily adopted by anyone for any application. Ongoing research in this pillar includes 1) creating open-source sensor toolkits, 2) developing frameworks for developers to create human-centered energy-constrained systems, and 3) using augmented and virtual reality to facilitate developing and debugging of smart environments.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> My </span>  research interests cover a wide range, mainly in the intersections of control theory, geometry, network sciences, machine learning, and game theory. For the purpose of this brief note, I focus on one recent topic that has occupied some of my time.</p>
<p>The abundance of access to data and advanced sensing apparatus has made the interplay between "uncertainty", "stability", and "performance" at the cusp of focus for achieving certifiable autonomy. Providing such certificates is in the roots of control theory, with the foundations of robustness and adaptation going back decades. Adaptive control, for instance, was built precisely to deal with unknown parameters while providing some stability certificates. Much of the classical development of the subject, however, was focused on systems with models at hand. The key challenge in nowadays complex problems such as autonomous driving is lack of such models, along with the fact that the decisions are made in an online fashion. The latter is in sharp contrast with offline problems in machine learning, such as algorithms behind Alpha Go, where training algorithms provide incomparable results. On the other hand, model-free techniques, such as reinforcement learning, often do not come with stability guarantees. The expected standards for future autonomous vehicles are in a way that robustness and stability guarantees are indispensable.</p><p>As control theorists, we are often concerned with stability; we do not want systems to go unstable, ever. In this sense, we are trained to be conservative. Learning about unknowns, by its nature, requires exploration, and enforcing stability prevents exploratory decisions. If the objective is for an autonomous vehicle to follow a certain path, with the abundance of unknowns present, implementing classical control strategies with robustness certificates would simply bring the car to halt. In this sense, if the measure of performance is how well the path is followed, the performance will be very poor. On the contrary, core techniques in machine learning, ranging from online optimization to reinforcement learning, are often solely concerned with performance. Even though it is a gross generalization, the interplay I depicted is present across the board. The key question that I am interested in is on how to mathematically capture this interplay, and how to generate certificates that meet the standards of future autonomous systems.</p>


<!-- TANG -->
Alumni Adrian Tang Recognized by IEEE MTT-S

<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> As recognition </span> for his outstanding achievements as a young member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer’s Microwave Theory and Techniques Society, Dr. Adrian Tang of UCLA has been chosen as a 2021 recipient of the Society’s Outstanding Young Engineer Award. In contrast to the Society’s other accolades, the Outstanding Young Engineer Award is distinct for its recognition of the person behind specific achievements, as opposed to the achievements themselves.</p><p>Dr. Tang’s revolutionary work surrounding the infusion of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOS) in space instrumentation allows for entirely different measurement and visualization techniques of our planet’s atmosphere, more specifically how water and greenhouse gases are able to traverse it. These new instrument design techniques allow researchers a new lens via which to study the process of climate change and can even help in updating existing models and trends. One of the planetary science instruments benefiting most from Dr. Tang’s work is the Planetary Instrument for Submillimeter-wave Surface and Atmospheric Reconnaissance and Research in Orbit (PISSARRO). This instrument allows scientists to observe planetary moon surfaces and even detect water on ancient celestial bodies like asteroids and comets; Dr. Tang’s work allows science instruments like this to operate on a scale and scope magnitudes beyond what was previously possible. With this new data we are able to gain a deeper insight not only into our own planet, but also planets throughout the galaxy that may contain life. These incredible developments were put on full display during a NASA sub-orbital mission in 2019 that Dr. Tang led, named, the Reck-Tang Limbsounding Experiment or “ReckTangLE.”</p>




<!-- CARBAJO -->
Designing light to film molecules in action

<p style="text-indent:0;"><span class="first-letter"> Whether a horse </span> is momentarily airborne, with all its feet off the floor at once, was a question that had plagued eccentric photographer Eadweard Muybridge until in 1872, he was asked by Leland Stanford, then governor of California, to take up the challenge of photographing his horse while galloping to see whether artists had been right in their depiction of the flying horse. For the photography of the time, Muybridge succeeded at this challenging task by triggering 12 different cameras as the horses ran past to create a sequential series of photographs of the motion.</p><p>

Many of today’s basic questions in physics and engineering are studied using this same photographic concept, albeit at far smaller and faster scales approaching fundamental atomic scales. That is, if we see something happening that occurs in 100 milliseconds (a tenth of a second), we generally perceive the event as occurring instantaneously. But for quantum systems, such as atoms, molecules, and condensed matter systems, this may even be longer than their entire lifetime. Many of the changes atomic and molecular systems undergo occur on femtosecond (quadrillionth of a second) or faster timescales. This is such a short timescale that one femtosecond is to one second as one second is to about 32 million years.</p><p>

Through our research in the Quantum Light-Matter Cooperative (Q-LMC), we can develop unique instrumentation and capture changes in quantum systems relevant for myriad applications – from medicine to quantum technologies –far too fast and too small for standards cameras to resolve. By using the ultrashort and very bright pulses of uniquely engineering light, our research provides a means to watch exactly how molecules react when they interact with light or undergo changes, such as photo-chemical reactions, protein dynamics, or quantum electrodynamics, among many others.</p>

<h3> Engineering light as scientific instrumentation</h3>
<p></p>One way of accessing unprecedentedly bright pulses of light is using X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL), which are usually miles-long facilities that accelerate electrons to the speed of light and then wiggle them with magnets. As part of our research portfolio, the Q-LMC develops new light-electron techniques to manipulate the electron beams that are used not only in XFEL experiments but also for another type of experiment, ultrafast electron diffraction (UED). In the latter, rather than shining X-rays on a molecule to film its motion, UED uses electrons instead. By detecting how the path of the electrons has changed as a result of interacting with the molecule, a picture can be constructed of how the molecule looked at a particular moment in time. As well as making XFELs better, the Q-LMC investigates ways to make them smaller and democratize access to these incredible machines. The length of the accelerators is necessary to provide sufficiently strong field gradients to accelerate the electrons up to speed, ideally in an orderly fashion. We study laser-driven accelerators may offer a more compact alternative to traditional radio frequency technology-based designs for applications in targeted radiation therapy and future quantum information technologies. The strong field gradients produced within a laser pulse make it possible to achieve comparable acceleration in a matter of millimeters, rather than miles.</p>

<h3>Applications of engineering light</h3>
<p>These incredibly powerful light sources make tracking physical chemistry in the femtosecond and even attosecond scale possible. To date, there have been countless discoveries made possible by engineered light technologies, such as tracking and identifying the intermediate chemical structures involved in water oxidation, an important part of photosynthesis, and seeing the structures and shapes of proteins at an unparalleled level of detail. Working on more challenging chemical systems which only produce weak signals or are very dilute will also be made possible with developments in the technology.</p>

Higher peak brightness also opens the possibility of exploring new regimes of physics, such as non-linear processes and exotic strong-field effects. Being able to explore the possibilities of experiments with structured light and in these extreme conditions is crucial for developing our understanding of how light interacts with matter. Given the strong interest in using light in many areas of our lives, from cancer treatment with photodynamic therapy, to as a renewable energy source with solar technologies or negative emission technologies to tackle our climate crisis, gaining this fundamental understanding of light-matter interactions is crucial for knowing how to exploit it in the development of new and more efficient technologies.</p>


<p>Over the last decade, Sergio Carbajo's research has been dedicated to the pursuit of transformational photon and particle sources and their applications in basic and environmental sciences, medicine, and industry. Photon and particle sources are powerful tools with extremely high societal impact because they underpin myriad ground-breaking scientific, technological, and medical advancements. He carried out a joint doctoral program simultaneously at the Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Center for Free Electron Laser Science, Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, and obtained his Ph.D. in Physics in 2015. In addition to being an assistant professor at the UCLA ECE department, Sergio is affiliated with the Linac Coherent Light Source at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the UCLA Physics department. He has received several awards recognizing his contributions to the development of novel ultrafast photon and particle sources, and their application in ultrafast phenomena for life and energy sciences, including the 2021 Horizon Prize from the Royal Society of Chemistry, the 2021 SPIE Early Career Achievement Award, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship in 2019, the SRI 2018 Young Scientist Award, and the PIER Helmholtz Foundation Dissertation Award in 2015, among others. He is actively engaged in professional service and outreach activities devoted to underrepresented minorities and to promote equity in educational and professional opportunities. <span><i>https://light-matter.seas.ucla.edu</i></span> </p>




<!-- Kat Echazarreta -->

<p style="text-indent:0;">  <span class="first-letter"> As a Child, </span> Kat Echazarreta ’19 was fascinated by electricity. How does electricity work? And why? How can electricity be used to create new technologies? Now, this UCLA electrical engineering alumna is working at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). She knows the answers to all those questions, and more. Inside her world at JPL, Echazarreta is an electrical engineer with the Ground Support Equipment team where she designs, builds and tests equipment vital to the Europa Clipper mission. NASA’s goal is to launch the spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter’s moon Europa in 2024 to determine whether Europa can harbor conditions suitable for life.</p>

<p> Before landing her dream job at JPL, Echazarreta notes in her blog that her educational journey was not a straight shot. Born in Mexico, Echazarreta moved with her family to the U.S. at the age of seven after her father received a work visa. She faced a language barrier at first, making it difficult to adjust to her new home. But within two years, she became a fluent English speaker. “It was definitely an obstacle for me to learn about a brand new culture and to learn a brand new language,” Echazarreta said. “I recall being made fun of for my accent, but I was determined to push through. It helped me become really hard working from a young age, and to not be afraid of a challenge.” Echazarreta, a first-generation college student, credits her mom for instilling in her a strong work ethic and encouraging her to follow her passions in space, astronomy and math. After high school, she enrolled in the San Diego City College studying electrical engineering for three years before transferring to UCLA. “When I first visited UCLA, I felt like I had found my second home,” Echazarreta said. “I had found the place that would help me become the engineer I wanted to become.”</p>

<p> As a transfer student, Echazarreta said it was difficult at first to keep up with the fast-paced curriculum. Navigating the quarter system wasn’t easy, especially because it seemed as though her classmates already knew one another. She overcame these challenges by readjusting her priorities. “I realized that in order to succeed I needed to take care of myself,” Echazarreta said. “I had to learn how to prioritize myself in order to be fully present during class and study sessions.”</p>

<p> While at UCLA, Echazarreta was involved in robotics research, which provided hands-on experience with developing testing procedures that helped her secure her first internship at JPL. Echazarreta was also active in the Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity (CEED) and the Society of Latino Engineers and Scientists (SOLES), both of which supported her academic endeavors and had a positive impact on her career. </p>

<p> Outside of her work at JPL, Echazarreta uses her social media to embolden and motivate others. Echazarreta acts as a “big sister” for other young women interested in STEM, she said, creating and sharing content she wishes she had seen when she was in school and searching for internships and jobs. “I hope that through my work with social media, other young women, girls and aspiring engineers will see that there is a place for them within these large organizations,” Echazarreta said.</p>

<p> With more than 26,000 followers on Instagram, Echazarreta regularly posts photos from her job and videos on what it’s like to be a woman in engineering. She also shares resources and inspiring stories about her personal journey to becoming an engineer. “I hope that through my work with social media, other young women, girls and aspiring engineers will see that there is a place for them within these large organizations,” Echazarreta said. “It’s important for me to share my story with others who feel like giving up.”</p>

<p> For students interested in following a similar career path, Echazarreta suggests attending career fairs and conferences, and networking as much as possible. Mentors from internships can also help students find jobs after graduation. “[Finding a job] takes persistence,” Echazarreta said. “It was five months before I heard back from JPL for my first position with them.” Looking ahead, Echazarreta is starting a part-time Master’s program in electrical engineering this upcoming fall at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, while continuing to work full-time at JPL. “I\'m excited to keep learning, earn larger technical leadership roles and continue to inspire others along the way,” she said. </p>
